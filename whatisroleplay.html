<center><h2> ~ • RP Rules • ~ </h2>
<br>
<p> • While roleplaying, please don't use profanity or overdo romance. Keep it PG.</p> 
<br>
<p> • Don't bully other characters or virtual characters into doing things (overstepping your boundaries). The moderator will decide what (for the most part) happens.  For example, you can't write, 'Lila stepped over and smacked the puppet master smartly on the face. She giggled as he fell over the cliff.' You CAN write, 'Lila tried to smack the puppet master on the face to prevent him from attacking the rest of the tribe.' In that case, the MOD will decide what happens next to the puppet master. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Try to use proper punctuation/grammar. We all make errors, but it doesn't help if your sentence is like, 'Arnold romped ran and jumped around in the field trying to chase the butterfly and fairy unicorns but failed and fell right on his hed he cryd out help help help come help.' It's much easier to read a sentence with proper punctuations. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Speak in third or first tense unless the forum states otherwise. </p> 
<br>
<p> • You don't have to use quotations in this form. Whatever you write is said out loud. Any actions you do are put in asteracts **. Ex. 'That would be amazing. *Arya sets down ten crystal coins on the counter.* Have a nice day!' However, if you like quotations, go ahead. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Be consistent with your online username. It gets confusing if you don't. </p> 
<br>
	<p> • Be creative and have fun! </p> </center>
