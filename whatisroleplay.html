<br>
	<h2>First of all, What is Roleplay?</h2> 
	<p>
Roleplay is a game of adventure where you become your character. You can be a unicorn, robot, or even a magestic dragon. There
are two types of role play on this site. In one type, like <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/thefantasyclub/harrypotter.ht
ml"> A Harry Potter Adventure, </a> you follow the prewritten script. In the other type, such as <a href="https://ellabc23.
github.io/thefantasyclub/townofdreams.html">The Town of Dreams,</a> you become your own character and can come up with your own
stories for the prechosen theme. However, if you submit your ideas to the <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/thefantasyclub
/choosethetheme.html">Choose the Theme</a> page, your username and/or idea might be featured in a new roleplay world!
	
	
	
	
	
<h2>What are the Rules?</h2>
	
	<p> • While roleplaying, please don't use profanity or overdo romance. Keep it PG.</p> 
<br>
<p> • Don't bully other characters into doing things or harm others. For example, you can't write, 'Lila stepped over and smacked the puppet master smartl
y on the face. She giggled as he fell over the cliff.' You CAN write, 'Lila tried to smack the puppet master on the face to prevent him
from attacking the rest of the tribe.' If any In that case, the  will decide what happens next to the puppet master. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Try to use proper punctuation/grammar. We all make errors, but it doesn't help if your sentence is like, 'Arnold romped ran and jumped around in the field trying to chase the butterfly and fairy unicorns but failed and fell right on his hed he cryd out help help help come help.' It's much easier to read a sentence with proper punctuations. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Speak in third or first tense unless the forum states otherwise. </p> 
<br>
<p> • You don't have to use quotations in this form. Whatever you write is said out loud. Any actions you do are put in asteracts **. Ex. 'That would be amazing. *Arya sets down ten crystal coins on the counter.* Have a nice day!' However, if you like quotations, go ahead. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Be consistent with your online username. It gets confusing if you don't. </p> 
<br>
	<p> • Be creative and have fun! </p> </center>
