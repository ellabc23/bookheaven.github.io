<br>
	<h2>First of all, What is Roleplay?</h2> 
	<p>
Roleplay is a game of adventure where you become your character. You can be a unicorn, robot, or even a magestic dragon. There
are two types of role play on this site. In one type, like <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/thefantasyclub/harrypotter.ht
ml"> A Harry Potter Adventure, </a> you follow the prewritten script. In the other type, such as <a href="https://ellabc23.
github.io/thefantasyclub/townofdreams.html">The Town of Dreams,</a> you become your own character and can come up with your own
stories for the prechosen theme. However, if you submit your ideas to the <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/thefantasyclub
/choosethetheme.html">Choose the Theme</a> page, your username and/or idea might be featured in a new roleplay world!
	
	
	
	
	
<h2>What are the Rules?</h2>
	
	<p> • While roleplaying, please don't overdo romance for the younger users. Keep it PG.</p> 
<br>
<p> • Don't bully or harm other characters. For example, you can't write, 'Amy swallowed the deadly poison, not knowing 
her sister would cruelly atrack her the hour after.' You CAN write, 'Amy swallowed the lemonade, not knowing 
her sister would save her from the monster.' If thing get out of hand, the MOD, ellabc23, will decide what happens next. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Try to use proper punctuation and grammar. We all make mistakes, but it doesn't help if your sentence is somewhat 
like, 'Hi ther Molly and Ms Mom did yu se the movie with the dog with to blu eys i dId withe ron, henry, an audry. On saturday'
It's much easier to read a sentence with proper punctuations. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Speak in first person unless the world text or mod states otherwise. </p> 
<br>
<p> • You don't have to use quotations. Whatever you write is said out loud. Any actions you do are put in asteracts. For 
example, 'I'm so bored. *Shelby lays on the sliver couch.* I'm going to go to sleep ' However, if you like quotations, go ah
ead. Just make sure you tell the chat first.</p> 
<br>
<p> • Be consistent with your online username. It gets confusing if you don't. </p> 
<br>
	<p> • Be creative and have fun! </p> </center>
