 <h1>Mimi walks over to you,</h1>
  <p>a twinkle in her eyes. "So, you want to question me? I have a game to play. I'll ask you a question, and you'll ask me one!"
      <p>
        You agree and Mimi asks you about everything, including your family, friends, and school. You have to lie about where
        you live. The DOA wouldn't like it if you told a girl that you lived in their headquarters! You go on like this for
        hours until it's almost past curfew time.
          <p>
            You lie in bed and review your notes.
            <p>          
  <i>Mimi
  <p>
    •From 'Fields, Nebraska'
     <p>
    •Has a brother, Tom Gaxson, age 4
      <p>  
       •Loves lions and "Oh, I... completly HATE snakes... *nervous laugh*"
        •"Totally NOT a Death Eater..."

               <p>
                 The crowd walks up to a portrait of a lady trying to shatter glass with her voice. There are various
                 murmurings of "the Fat Lady!" as Emma states the password, which happens to be "darkness comes and eats
                 omelets."
                 <p>
                   As you enter the common room, you stare at its amazing red and gold glory. "Amazing," Mimi gapes. The
                   rest of the day is full of chocolate, wonder, and no hopes of investigation.
                   <p>
                     <i>Time to make some friends,</i> you think as people scurry around the common room. Then you remember
                     your mission. <i> But this will help. I already know that Emma is safe, but I don't know much about the 
                     rest of Gryffindor. </i>
                     <p>
