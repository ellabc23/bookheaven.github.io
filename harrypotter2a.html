 <h1>Griffyndor,</h1>
  <p>the house of the brave and adventurous! Mimi runs up to you, wearing crip, red robes. 
      <p>
        "I'm so happy that were in the same house! It's even better that we're in Griffindor! The house <i>Ginny Weasley</i>
        was in! This is utterly crazy!!!"
          <p>
            <i>Why Ginny? Most people would be thinking of Harry...</i> you think. Just then, a tall girl with a 'Head Girl' 
            badge, sleek black hair in a tight ponytail, and chestnut brown eyes walks over as a storm of newly-sorted 
            Griffindors head up the stairs. The mysterious girl looks like a fifth year.
               <p>
                 "Hello young Griffindors. I am Emma, the head girl and your welcome committee. If you have any questions, 
                 feel free to ask me." Emma winks at you subtly. <i>Emma is a DOA spy too! I can trust her.</i>
               <p>
                 The crowd walks up to a portrait of a lady trying to shatter glass with her voice. There are various
                 murmurings of "the Fat Lady!" as Emma states the password, which happens to be "darkness comes and eats
                 omelets."
                 <p>
                   As you enter the common room, you stare at its amazing red and gold glory. "Amazing," Mimi gapes. The
                   rest of the day is full of chocolate, wonder, and no hopes of investigation.
                   <p>
                     <i>Time to make some friends,</i> you think as people scurry around the common room. Then you remember
                     your mission. <i> But this will help. I already know that Emma is safe, but I don't know much about the 
                     rest of Gryffindor. </i>
                     <p>
