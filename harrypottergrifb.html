 <h1>You walk over to Dorothy, </h1>
  <p>
     who has a crowd of people surrounding her. She fashioned her robes into a stylish red and black dress. <i>How can I get 
     her attention?</i> you think. <i> Complements might work. </i>
      <p>
     "Dorothy, did you make that SPECTACULAR dress?"
   <p>
      "Actually, I did. What brings you to Dorothy the Great, fashion police? Are you here for an autograph? Here, I'll sign 
      your notepad." She writes her name in loopy cursive. You continue to shower her with complements until she agrees to be
      questioned.
            <p>
               "I'll let you answer any questions you might have about me. Just let me go before 3:00. I have to get my nails 
               done." You ask her questions until 2:45.
               <p>
                  <i>What information do I have?</i> You think. You pull out your crumpled notes.
                <p>
