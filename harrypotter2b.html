 <h1>Hufflepuff,</h1>
  <p>the house of the kind and patient! You put on your yellow robes and walk over to the waiting area for first years as
   you admire the scenery. Kind Mimi walks over to you quickly, holding up robes of her own.</p>
  <p>
        "Hello Zeji. Um, I'm so happy that we're in the same house. Hufflepuffs are really nice. Sorry that I'm not much of a
   talker, but I guess that just shows how much I resemble Hufflepuff steryotypes."
          <p>
           <i>People from her home must have been mean,</i> you think. Just then, a short boy with a 'Head Boy' 
            badge, fire-red hair, and bright violet eyes walks over as a storm of newly-sorted 
            Hufflepuffs head up the stairs. The boy looks like a fourth year.
               <p>
                 "Hello. I am Adam, the head boy. Young Hufflepuffs should never be suspicious ofor anything." Adam frowns slightly in your
                direction. <i>No matter what he says, I will always be suspicious.</i>
               <p>
                 The crowd walks up to a portrait of a man with a hat made of fruit asks, "What's the password?"
                           <p>
                            "Helga Hufflepuff helps horses," Adam says. The portrait swings open to reveal the common room.
                             <p>                  
                              As you enter the room, you stare at the DOA leader's chair. It has your name on it! "Amazing,"
                              Mimi gapes. "Do you see that trophy? It says, 'to Mimi Gaxson, for being the bravest Hufflepuff
                              leader ever!'"
                   <p>
                    "You all see your heart's greatest desire," Adam says. "You can either choose to go to it, or not. Just 
                    remember, if you embrace your wish, "
                     <i>Time to make some friends,</i> you think as people scurry around the common room. Then you remember
                     your mission. <i> But this will help. I already know that Emma is safe, but I don't know much about the 
                     rest of Gryffindor. </i>
                     <p>
