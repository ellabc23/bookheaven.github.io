 <h1>You walk over to the corner</h1>
  <p>
    where Tommy is standing. He's looking at Dorothy, who radiates popularity and cool. He almost blends into the walls!
   <p>
     "Hi, I'm Taylor. You're... Tommy, right?" He nods his head without even looking at you! "Can I talk to you?" He nods again.
      "You have to talk. I'm... uh, starting a newspaper, and I need to interview you."
   <p>
      "Okay. Don't ask me too many questions, though. Hogwarts is scary! I have to be alert!"
               <p>
                  After your interrogation, Tommy slinks away. <i>I guess it's time to review my findings,</i> You think. You pull out
                  your neat notes.
                <p>
