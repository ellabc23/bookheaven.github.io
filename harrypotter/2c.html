 <h1>Ravenclaw,</h1>
  <p>the house of the smart and clever!You watch as Mimi puts on the Sorting Hat and hope she's a Ravenclaw. "Slytherin!" the 
   hat shouts.<i>That's too bad,</i> you think. Casey Current, a master at solving puzzles, walks over to you.</p>
<br>
 <p>"Say hi to the camera!" Casey holds up a state-of-the-art wand and continues talking. "And welcome back to Casey Current's
  Corner! On this live broadcast, I was sorted into Ravenclaw! Wando here," he nods at you, "Will tell you all about it!" 
 <p>
  "Uh... No comment..." you stutter.
 <p>
  Casey is separated from you by a cloud of landing Ravenclaws! "Hi," a girl with frizzy hair says. "I'm Ava. Who are you?"
  You respond, and instantly like her. She's nice, funny, and smart.
 <p>  
  "Stop! Don't move!" A fifth year runs over and everyone stops moving. She has black hair tied in a messy ponytail, dark brown eyes, 
  and a "Head Girl" pin. "Hi! I'm Brooklyn, the Head Girl of Ravenclaw. Sorry I'm late." She guides you to a portrait of a 
  scientist. "Wingardium LeviOsa, not Wingardium LeviosA," Brooklyn says. As the painting swings open, you think about your 
  allies. <i>Brooklyn is a DOA spy too! I can consult her for help, if I need any.</i>
 <p>
  "Ravenclaws get extra classes. Which one do you want to take? Also, which friend do you want to do it with?"
