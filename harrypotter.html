 <center><h1>The Fantasy Club Role Play: A Harry Potter Adventure</h1></center>
  
  <p> In this role play game, the adventure calls for you (a member of the Mythical Creature Rescue Committee) to go to the coast of Lyrae. The creatures there (mostly dragons and unicorns) are threatened by Lyddia, the famous sorceress, and need to evacuate before she tries to manipulate their powers... Can you convince them to leave their homeland before the sorceress brings all to ruin? *Checks watch hurriedly.* Sorry, have to rush to OCA now for an important meeting. I'm counting on you! </p>
