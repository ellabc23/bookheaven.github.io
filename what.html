	<h1> What are Roleplay Cities? </h1>
	<p>
Roleplay Cities are worlds where you build your <i>town</i> community, not to be confused with prechosen themes about
something other than a town, such as <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/thefantasyclub/oex.html">Lillia's Wolf World.</a>
An example of a roleplay city is <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/thefantasyclub/townofdreams.html">The Town of Dreams,</a>
an active chat where you become your own character and share your own stories and plans for the town's future. If you want an 
example of a finished world, I suggest you <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/thefantasyclub/ex.html">click here.</a>
