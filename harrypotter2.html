 <h1>Welcome to Hogwarts,</h1>
  <p>the school of witchcraft and wizardry! You are about to enter the incredible school seriously, when you remember that you
    have to pretend to be a first year. Sometimes being really short gets you the best missions. Though there are many things
    you have to watch out for, you decide to try to have a bit of fun. You see Ella slipped you some notes and you read them. </p>
<br>
<p>• Beware of the DE, who believe we don't know they are recreating the Death Eaters group. Many are fifth years in Slytherin.</p>
 <p>• Brooklyn and Emma are also helping us. They're in Ravenclaw and Griffyndor.</p>  
 <p> Finish that mission! </p> 
  <p><~Ella/p>
 <br>
 
 <p>At the Great Hall, you meet a girl named Mimi. She seems very excited. Her wand is made out of bendy acacia wood and 
   unicorn hair. You and Mimi become fast friends. Everything is so magical! You notice that the floating candles seem to
   be more droopy than usual. Tom Riddle's magic is already workng... You breathe in the sweet air as your nose hits the delightful scents of clover, cinnamon, honey, and peppermint. After wandering around for a couple minutes, you remember your mission and check your map. The marked x's are the places you have to go to find the mythical creatures. You sigh, knowing you have a lot to do. Suddenly, a cloaked figure on a chestnut stallion comes rushing from the opposite end of the street. You assume he is a Drawa Hunter. As he draws closer, you begin to tremble ever so slightly. </p>

 <p> Suddenly, as the man is about three yards away, he dismounts and walks toward you. "Citizenship badge," he says, as if it were his business. </p>
