 <h1>Welcome to Hogwarts,</h1>
  <p>the school of witchcraft and wizardry! You are about to enter the incredible school seriously, when you remember that
you have to pretend to be a first year. Sometimes being really short gets you the best missions! Though there are many things
you have to watch out for, you decide to try to have a bit of fun. You see Ella slipped you some notes and you read them. </p>
<br>
<p>• Beware of the DE, who believe we don't know they are recreating the Death Eaters group. Many are fifth years in Slytherin.</p>
 <p>• Brooklyn and Emma, secret agents, are also helping us. They're in Ravenclaw and Griffyndor.</p>  
 <p> Finish that mission! </p> 
  <p>~Ella</p>
 <br>
 
 <p>At the Great Hall, you meet a girl named Mimi. She seems very excited. Her wand is made out of bendy acacia wood and 
   unicorn hair. You and Mimi become fast friends. Everything is so magical! You notice that the floating candles seem to
   be drooping lower than usual. Tom Riddle's magic is already workng. Delicious food magically appears. Chocolate frogs, 
   every-flavor-beans, and sour cherry pie floods the tables. As you eat, you study the teachers. Headmistress Renereet
   surveys the students while Professer Ultimania stares directly at Mimi. Could he be the culprit? When sluthing, you should
   always be suspicious.
   
   <p>Headmistress Renereet holds up the Sorting Hat. "Taylor, you are the first to be sorted." You slip on the hat and
     watch it search your mind. 'A brave one, who is clever enough to pass the Dumbledore test. Caring, yet a sure craving to
     be known. You could fit into any of these catagories, but now it is all up to you.' </p>
