  <p> In this adventure, you are Melissa, a skeptical girl. In the town of Beachwash everyone believes that mermaids are real,
includig your grandma, your only family. When your unheard of mother sends you a note, your life is turned upside down.
  <p>
   <i>My dearest Melissa,</i>
   <p>
    It has been far too long since I have contacted you. I cannot talk much, but you must come. Meet me at Shello Lake when
    the stars are aligned, or as you may call it, tomorrow. You must bring all of your possessions, for you will not be 
    returning to the little Beachwash town you call home. Do not forget. Tomorrow at sunset, at Shello Lake. Give your 
    grandmother my regards,
     <p>
    《《《~Elenora》》》
