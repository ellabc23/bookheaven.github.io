 <h1>Ravenclaw,</h1>
  <p>the house of the smart and clever!You watch as Mimi puts on the Sorting Hat and hope she's a Ravenclaw. "Slytherin!" the 
   hat shouts.<i>That's too bad,</i> you think. Casey Current, a master at solving puzzles walks over to you.</p>
<br>
 <p>"Say hi to the camera!" Casey holds up a state-of-the-art wand and continues talking. "And welcome back to Casey Current's
  Corner! On this live broadcast, I was sorted into Ravenclaw! Wando here," she nods at you, "Will tell you all about it!" 
 <p>
  "Uh... No comment..." you stutter.
 <p>
  Casey is separated from you by a cloud of landing Ravenclaws!
 <p>  
  "Stop!" A fifth year runs over and everyone stops moving. She has black hair tied in a messy ponytail, dark brown eyes, 
  and a "Head Girl" pin. "Hi! I'm Brooklyn, the Head Girl of Ravenclaw. Sorry I'm late." She guides you to a portrait of a 
  scientist. "Wingardium LeviOsa, not Wingardium LeviosA," Brooklyn says. <i>Brooklyn is a DOA spy too! I can consult her for
  help if I need any.</i>
 <p>
  
 <p> 
 <br>
 
 <p>After finishing, you walk around and try to get to know the place better. The street pavement is bright blue and sprightly, lilting music comes out of every town cottage. You notice that the music seems to take a physical form, like mist, and constantly changes. Some even have an aroma! You breathe in the sweet air as your nose hits the delightful scents of clover, cinnamon, honey, and peppermint. After wandering around for a couple minutes, you remember your mission and check your map. The marked x's are the places you have to go to find the mythical creatures. You sigh, knowing you have a lot to do. Suddenly, a cloaked figure on a chestnut stallion comes rushing from the opposite end of the street. You assume he is a Drawa Hunter. As he draws closer, you begin to tremble ever so slightly. </p>

 <p> Suddenly, as the man is about three yards away, he dismounts and walks toward you. "Citizenship badge," he says, as if it were his business. </p>
