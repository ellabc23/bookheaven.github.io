 <h1>You walk over to Henry, </h1>
  <p>
     who is admiring the first golden snitch thrown at Hogwarts. He is also talking to Mimi and another girl.<i> How can I 
     interrogate him now? </i> you think. <i>I know! I was trained in Quiddich, so if I challenge him to a game, I might be able to get
     information out of him.</i>
      <p>
     "Hi, Henry. do you want to play one on one Quiddich?"
   <p>
      "Sure! I'm always up for a game!" You head out to the Quiddich field and grab a Firebolt 3100 and start flying.
            <p>
               "I'll let you answer any questions you might have about me. Just let me go before 3:00. I have to get my nails 
               done." You ask her questions until 2:45.
               <p>
                  <i>What information do I have?</i> You think. You pull out your crumpled notes.
