 <h1>You walk over to Henry, </h1>
  <p>
     who is admiring the first golden snitch thrown at Hogwarts. He is also talking to Mimi and another girl.<i> How can I 
     interrogate him now, </i> you think. <i>I was trained in quiddich, so if I challenge him to a game, </i>
      <p>
     "Dorothy, did you make that SPECTACULAR dress?"
   <p>
      "Actually, I did. What brings you to Dorothy the Great, fashion police? Are you here for an autograph? Here, I'll sign 
      your notepad." She writes her name in loopy cursive. You continue to shower her with complements until she agrees to be
      questioned.
            <p>
               "I'll let you answer any questions you might have about me. Just let me go before 3:00. I have to get my nails 
               done." You ask her questions until 2:45.
               <p>
                  <i>What information do I have?</i> You think. You pull out your crumpled notes.
