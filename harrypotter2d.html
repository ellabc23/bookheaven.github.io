 <h1>Slytherin,</h1>
  <p>the house of the cunning and ambitious! <i>This will let me meet those DE members,</i> you think. A centaur stamps up to
    you. "Hey, you should put on your robes before someone beats you up," a tough looking second-year boy swoops in from behind.
    "I'm Cody, the new Draco Malfoy. Well, I'm at least trying to be. I joined that silly little Death Eater club, but nobody
    respects me! Oh, I should get out of here..." Cody slips into the shadows as a confident girl creeps up on the unsuspecting
    Slytherins.</p>
<br>
<p>
  "Hello Slytherins. I am Cassidy, the Head Girl and Quiddich champion for four years. Don't even think about beating me, for 
  you will ALWAYS FAIL." She looks directly in your eyes with a hard glare. 
  <p>
    "I'll let you into the common room if I have to... Pickled herring!" and with a florish, the painting opened up. 
    Slytherins jumped into a water slide! "Come on," Cassidy says boredly. She stepped into the slide, and disappeared. You 
    take a step into darkness...
  <p>
    You fall for what seems like forever, but you're in the underwater common room! Snake 
    emblems are everywhere!
 <p>  
   "What are you doing? You can't just BUMP into ME, now can you?" Cody is bullying a first year girl who looks defenceless.
 <p> 
   "Nn..oo. Def..initely not..." she stutters. "Cody Crackson! What are you doing? Beating up a little girl?"<i> Cassidy 
   looks like she has it under control,</i> you think. "Well, I want in!" who will stop them? Only you can.
   <p>
     You jump into the action and Cody falters. "What's wrong, Crackson? You scared?" Cassidy shrieks. Cody immediately puts 
     his  brave face on. You check in your pockets. You have magic powder! You blow it all over the goons and run away!
 <p> 
   "Thanks for saving me. I'm Celeste. Do you want to play quidditch with me?" She looks at you hopefully.
  <p> 
<i>Should I go with Celeste or investigate?</i>
  <center><b><i>What do you do? </i></b></center>
