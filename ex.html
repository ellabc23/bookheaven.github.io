<p>They are usually 80⊙, but for you my old friend, I'll sell for 60⊙. How's that?</p>

<p>Thank you so much! 
 <p>(balance: 3⊙ and 29 speckled potatoes)</p> 
<p>She walked over to a huge cluster of mushrooms, all of them a color variety of glowing peach, strawberry bright red, 
 hot pink, luminous green, orangish yellow, sunset purple, and varieties of magentas. "The two blue ones are near the large 
 oak tree. Oh, I found it!" Jenni reached down and plucked two light blue mushrooms out and put it in her satchel. "One item 
 down. But the other ingredients might not be too easy, I'm afraid." </p>

<p>Suddenly her face turns pale. "Oh no. Hear that? A werewolf is near. They're too strong and powerful for us to fight." Jenni turns toward you. "Run!" </p>
