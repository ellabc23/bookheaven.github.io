<p>"Yes," Jenni grinned. "This is the Theran Woods. If you listen carefully, you can hear the young fairies singing. The two blue mushrooms are nearby, let me show you."</p> 

<p>She walked over to a huge cluster of mushrooms, all of them a color variety of glowing peach, strawberry bright red, hot pink, luminous green, orangish yellow, sunset purple, and varieties of magentas. "The two blue ones are near the large oak tree. Oh, I found it!" Jenni reached down and plucked two light blue mushrooms out and put it in her satchel. "One item down. But the other ingredients might not be too easy, I'm afraid." </p>

<p>Suddenly her face turns pale. "Oh no. Hear that? A werewolf is near. They're too strong and powerful for us to fight." Jenni turns toward you. "Run!" </p>
